**Chromosomal evolution in Lepidoptera**

Using data from more than 200 genomes, the authors of this article traced the dynamics of chromosomal changes in species belonging to the Lepidoptera. Although chromosomes generally remain evolutionarily stable, global rearrangements caused by fusions and fissions are also found.

The Lepidoptera are one of the most karyotypically diverse groups, and although in most species the number of chromosomes ranges from 29 to 31, in some lineages significant rearrangements occur and the haploid set of chromosomes can range from 5 to 223.

Based on analyses of single-copy orthologues, the authors were able to trace the evolution of chromosomal structure and identify key events of chromosomal fusions and fissions.

**Methods**

The study used more than 5,000 single-copy orthologues and four species of Trichoptera to root the phylogenetic tree. The syngraph programme was used to identify linkage groups and to trace the evolutionary history of chromosome rearrangements.

Although previous studies have identified 31 linkage groups, the authors were able to show that the common ancestor of Lepidoptera originally had 32 groups, including 31 autosomal and sex Z chromosomes. These elements were called ‘Merian elements’, and remarkably, they have remained largely stable over 250 million years of evolution.

With the exception of 14 species from 8 lineages, in which multiple fusions and fissions have been observed.


Here is the phylogenetic tree obtained for 210 species on the left and haploid chromosome set number and genome size on the right. Lines with at least 1 rearrangement are highlighted in orange, whereas lines with global rearrangements are highlighted in red.

That said, most of the fusions were relatively young from an evolutionary perspective - they were characteristic of a single species or a recent clade. Except for 25 that were common to all descendants of specific phylogenetic nodes, indicating their older origins.

**Evolutionary discoveries**

It was able to trace an ancient fusion of elements M17 and M20 that occurred on a branch leading to the last common ancestor of Ditrysia, the most diverse group of Lepidoptera. Since the species *Micropterix aruncella* and the last common ancestor Trichoptera both retain the same M17 and M20 as separate chromosomes, the assumption that the fusion of these elements occurred after the separation of the early lineages is confirmed.

**Chromosome fusions and fissions**

There is considerable variation in the eight lineages, and the authors have decided to divide them into two groups, those characterised by fusions only and those with both fusions and fissions.

For example, the genus Lysandra, has undergone numerous fissions, resulting in an increase in the number of chromosomes. In other lineages, such as Pierini, both fissions and fusions were observed.

**Conclusion**

- Small as well as sex Merian elements are more often involved in fusion processes.
- Sex chomosomes were not involved in any of the cases in the rearrangement processes of associated fission.
- Complex rearrangements were observed in 14 species of 8 lineages.
- Although rearrangements are not uncommon in other species with holocentric chromosomes, there were no other global rearrangements (except in some lineages) in scales except for the fusion of 17 and 20 elements 200 million years ago

Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this:


1. The rearrangements may result in heterozygosity for the rearrangements, which could cause problems during meiosis. 
2. Chromosomes may be stable due to Cys-regulation of genes, when rearrangements occur their linkage and coordination will be disrupted.
3. Although chromosomal changes can favour speciation, on large time scales they can be detrimental to survival. Species with high rates of change often also have high rates of extinction.
